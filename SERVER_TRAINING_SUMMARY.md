# Server Training Preparation Summary

## Fixed Issues and Improvements

We've made several fixes and improvements to prepare the XLSR-Transducer multi-stage training for the server:

1. **Fixed import issues** in the training code:
   - Changed relative imports to absolute imports in `trainer.py`
   - Created a `Trainer` adapter class to match the expected interface

2. **Created a wrapper script** (`run_training.py`) that:
   - Correctly sets up the Python path
   - Ensures modules can be properly imported
   - Passes command line arguments to the training script

3. **Updated the stages configuration** (`config/stages.yaml`):
   - Changed `encoder` key to `encoder_params` to match the expected structure
   - Updated checkpoint paths to use full paths
   - Added explicit chunk size for multi-chunk training

4. **Added convenience scripts and documentation**:
   - Created `README_SERVER.md` with detailed instructions
   - Added `setup.py` for installable package option
   - Ensured all checkpoint directories exist

## Testing and Visualization

The attention sink testing and visualization script (`scripts/test_attention_sink.py`) has been verified to work and generates useful visualizations showing:

- Attention patterns for different attention mechanisms
- Comparison of connection density across mechanisms 
- Streaming simulation visualizations

## Next Steps for Server Training

1. **Initial Testing**: Run Stage 1 in debug mode to verify everything works:
   ```bash
   python run_training.py --start_stage 1 --debug
   ```

2. **Full Training**: Once verified, run the full training sequence:
   ```bash
   python run_training.py --start_stage 1 --end_stage 5
   ```

3. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor GPU usage, memory consumption, and logs

4. **Checkpointing**: Each stage will automatically load from the previous stage's best checkpoint

## Attention Sink Implementation Highlights

Our implementation of the attention sink mechanism includes:

- Dedicated `AttentionSink` class with configurable sink sizes
- Integration with the existing streaming attention mechanism
- Support for various left context sizes
- Multi-chunk training with randomized chunk sizes
- Comprehensive visualization tools

## Hardware Requirements

Based on the paper and model architecture:

- Minimum 16GB GPU memory
- Recommended: A100 (40GB) or equivalent for faster training
- Training time estimate: 12-24 hours per stage on a single high-end GPU
